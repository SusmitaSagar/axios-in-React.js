Promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A Promise is in one of these states:                https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other methods, too, but they are utilized less frequently
